Sum of all proper divisors of a natural number

Given a natural number, calculate sum of all its proper divisors. A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.

For example, number 20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22.

Examples:

Input : num = 10
Output: 8
// proper divisors 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 

Input : num = 36
Output: 55
// proper divisors 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55
